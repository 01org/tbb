<H2>Python* API for Intel&reg; Threading Building Blocks (Intel&reg; TBB).
</H2>

<H2>Overview</H2>
It is a preview Python* module which unlocks opportunities for additional performance in multi-threaded and multiprocess Python programs by enabling threading composability
between two or more thread-enabled libraries like Numpy, Scipy, Sklearn, Dask, Joblib, and etc.
<p></p>
The biggest improvement can be achieved when a task pool like the ThreadPool or Pool from the Python standard library or libraries like Dask or Joblib (used either in multi-threading or multi-processing mode)
execute tasks calling compute-intensive functions of Numpy/Scipy/Sklearn/PyDAAL which in turn are parallelized using Intel&reg; Math Kernel Library or/and Intel&reg; TBB.
<p></p>
The module implements Pool class with the standard interface using Intel&reg; TBB which can be used to replace Python's ThreadPool.
Thanks to the monkey-patching technique implemented in class Monkey, no source code change is needed in order to enable threading composability in Python programs.
<p></p>

<A NAME=build><H2>Build and install</H2></A>
Prior to building it, please do the following first:
<UL>
<LI>Download this source package;</LI>
<LI>Build Intel&reg; TBB (for more informantion, please refer to <A HREF="../index.html">documentation</A>);</LI>
<LI>Set up the environment using generated tbbvars.sh script that can be found in $TBBROOT/build/*_release/ or $TBBROOT/build/*_debug/ folders.</LI>

</UL>
<DL>
<DT><TT>make</TT>
<DD>Default build and run. Equivalent to 'make release test'.
<DT><TT>make release</TT>
<DD>Compile and link against the release version of Intel TBB runtime library. The resulting executable is left in the directory for the example.
<DT><TT>make test</TT>
<DD>Run local build of the module previously produced by one of the above commands.
<DT><TT>make install</TT>
<DD>Install module into Python.
<DT><TT>make <B>[</B>(above options or targets)<B>]</B> CXX=<B>{</B>icl, icc<B>}</B></TT>
<DD>Build and run as above, but use Intel&reg; C++ compiler instead of default, native compilers
(e.g., icl instead of cl.exe on Windows* systems, or icc instead of g++ on Linux* or macOS* systems).
Please note, CXX=icl works on Windows only with Intel&reg; Distribution for Python*.
<DT><TT>make clean</TT>
<DD>Remove any intermediate files produced by the above commands.
</DL>

<H2>Command-line interface</H2>
<DL>
<DT><TT>python -m tbb -h</TT>
<DD>Print documentation on command-line interface</DD>
<DT><TT>pydoc tbb</TT>
<DD>Read built-in documentation for Python interfaces.</DD>
<DT><TT>python-tbb your_script.py</TT>
<DT><TT>python -m tbb your_script.py</TT>
<DD>Run your_script.py in context of `with tbb.Monkey():` when Intel&reg; TBB is enabled. By default only multi-threading will be covered.</DD>
<DT><TT>python -m tbb --ipc your_script.py</TT>
<DD>Run your_script.py in context of `with tbb.Monkey():` when Intel&reg; TBB enabled in both multi-threading and multi-processing modes.</DD>
</DL>

<H2>System Requirements</H2>
The Python module was not tested on older versions of Python thus we require at least Python versions 2.7 and 3.5 or higher.<BR>
SWIG must be of version 3.0.6 or higher<BR>
OS versions:
Microsoft* Windows* Server 2012,
Microsoft* Windows* 10,
Ubuntu* 14.04 LTS,
Red Hat* Enterprise Linux* 7.
